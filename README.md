# Test-Driven Development - Tic Tac Toe Kata

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Rules. 
In random order

- a game is over when all fields in a row are taken by a player
- players take turns taking fields until the game is over
- a game is over when all fields in a diagonal are taken by a player
- a game is over when all fields are taken
- there are two players in the game (X and O)
- a game has nine fields in a 3x3 grid
- a game is over when all fields in a column are taken by a player
- a player can take a field if not already taken

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## TODO
- Test-Driven Development (Red -> Green -> Refactoring)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Sketch
- a game has nine fields in a 3x3 grid
    - 3x3 2d char array (initialize ' ')
    - refactoring array to 5x5 for drawing game board (to divide game blocks)
    

- there are two players in the game (X and O)
